# FilmDecision
Choosing a movie with someone can be tricky. 
I used to let my wife pick, because her happiness made me happy. BUT sometimes we could have a choice that we both liked. That’s why I created FilmDecision: a fun way for two people to swipe and find a movie they both agree on.

FilmDecision helps you:
- Quickly find a movie match
- Avoid endless debates
- Discover new films together

Perfect for couples, friends, or family movie nights!
